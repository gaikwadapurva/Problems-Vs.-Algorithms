### Analysis

This algorithm uses merge sort to sort the array in decreasing order at first and then rearranges the array digits forming two numbers resulting in maximum sum. 

Time complexity: The time complexity is O(nlog n).

Space complexity: The space complexity is linear O(n) where n is the input size because the size of the underlying array scales proportionally to the size of the input.
