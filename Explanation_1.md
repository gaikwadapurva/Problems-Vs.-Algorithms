### Analysis

This algorithm uses binary search between 0 and the number given to find the floored square root number. Binary search guarantees a logarithmic complexity since each iteration of the while loop cuts the range in half until the range is just one element left.

Time complexity: The time complexity is O(log n) since the solution uses binary search.

Space complexity: The space complexity is O(1) since a constant extra space is needed, regardless of input size.
