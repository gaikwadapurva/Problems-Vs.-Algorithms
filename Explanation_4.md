### Analysis

The idea is to put 0 and 2 in their correct positions, which will make sure all the 1s are automatically placed in their right positions.

Time complexity: The time complexity is linear O(n) because it sorts the array in a single traversal.

Space complexity: The space complexity is constant O(1) since the algorithm doesn't use any additional space other that the input array.
