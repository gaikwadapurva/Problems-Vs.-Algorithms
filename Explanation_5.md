### Analysis

The objective here is the development of a trie, a tree-like data structure to store a dynamic set of strings, which should have properties such as inserting a node (word) or finding a node which represents a prefix.

Time Complexity: The time complexity of the algorithm here is O(mn) where m is the length that is being searched for or being inserted into the trie, and n is the total number of words in the trie.

Space Complexity: Worst case space complexity would be there would be no words with common characters between them, i.e., O(n).
