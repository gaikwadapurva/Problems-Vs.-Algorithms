### Analysis

This algorithm uses two variables, min and max, to store the minimum and maximum number found in a single traversal of the array.

Time complexity: The time complexity is linear O(n) because it has only one for loop which iterates from 1 to n. 

Space complexity: The space complexity is constant O(1) because regardless of the size of the input array, the algorithm maintains a constant total size of new variables allocated in the memory during runtime.
